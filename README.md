# Tasks Summary
    <b>Task 1<b> - I used mkdir command to create two new folders within another folder in this repository. 
    They are timestamps & weather within the data folder.
    <b>Task 2<b> - I used date command to get the current date. 
    I then used the command i in {1..10} to start a loop that will iterate it 10 times. 
    I then added the command date >> now.txt: to retrieve the current date and >> creates a file called now.txt where the date & time is displayed 10 times.
